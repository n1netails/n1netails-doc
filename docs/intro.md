# N1netails Intro

## Alert Monitoring and Management
N1netails is an open-source project that provides practical alerts and monitoring for applications. It introduces the concept of 'tail-following' – the ability to not just see an alert, but to trace its path and context. This helps you quickly understand the sequence of events and pinpoint the root cause of issues. If you're tired of relying on complex SIEM tools to identify issues — or if your application lacks any alerting at all — N1netails offers a straightforward way to gain clarity on problems affecting your applications.
