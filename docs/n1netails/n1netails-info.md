## Alert Monitoring and Management
N1netails is an open-source project that provides practical alerts and monitoring for applications. If you're tired of relying on complex SIEM tools 
to identify issues — or if your application lacks any alerting at all — N1netails offers a straightforward way to gain 
clarity on problems affecting your applications.
